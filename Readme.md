# This is the core of a real life card game that a friend and 
# I developed. We spent so much time developing the game
# but in the end we realized that there are just too many numbers
# that you have to remember when you play. So I developed a little game
# State:
# The game is a bit messed up right now because effect 
# creatures are a bit to complicated for me right now
